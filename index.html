            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p> Fish and seafood are dietary cornerstones for Filipinos. The Philippines consumes ~40 kg of fish per person annually, making it the top source of animal protein. 
            <br><br>In the Philippines, seafood is a cheap and accessible source of protein, rich in micronutrients, such as iron, zinc, vitamin A, and omega 3 fatty acids. As such, seafood has significant potential to contribute towards alleviating food insecurity, malnutrition, stunting, and cardiovascular disease, while strengthening the immune system and improving maternal and childhood health outcomes.

          <p>Fish consumption provides docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid essential for brain development in infants and cognitive function in adults. Adequate intake during pregnancy and early childhood is linked to improved cognitive outcomes.<br><br>Also, regular fish consumption (≥2 servings/week) is linked to 20% lower depression risk and improved cognitive function. Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA/EPA) reduce neuroinflammation and support neurotransmitter activity.

<p>Like as stated in the previous page, <b>seafood is an important source of protein in the Filipino diet</b>, accounting for 42.2% of total animal protein intake and 18.3% of total protein intake. Accordingly, <b>the Philippines has long
been ranked among the top 10 fish producing countries in the world</b>, with the various fishery sectors a strategically important factor both in terms of food security.</p>

<br><p>Yet, despite the cultural, livelihood, and food-related importance of fisheries; it has been subject to <b>overexploitation due to lax policies</b> surrounding it. Even more so that in one of our EEZ, the <b>West Philippine Sea</b>—<span style="color: rgb(255, 44, 44);"><em>"a certain other country"</em></span> is the one doing it for their own benefit. Overextending their sovereignity, harming our environment with massive clamshell harvesting, overfishing, and underwater oil and gas exploration. <b>Continued illegal activities in our economic zones, while unseen under the waves, deals a hard blow to the millions of Filipinos in coastal areas.</b></p>
<br><p>Regarding <b>water security</b> it has been discovered that <b>microplastics has been contaminating our waters</b>. One example is the Laguna de Bay which is the largest lake in the country. A study conducted there suggests that prevalent microplastics in the area may pose a <b>threat to water quality and food chain the area.</b> The researchers also advise using biodegradable substitutes in place of plastic. Personally, as someone familiar with the area (my province), locals have noted that the rate and quantity of fishes has been dropping ever since factories started to appear. </p>

        <p>The ocean absorbs around 26% of all human-induced carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas responsible for climate change), causing an alteration in seawater chemistry called <b>ocean acidification</b>. It presents a serious threat to marine life, ecosystem health and people whose livelihoods depend on the ocean.</p><br>
        <p>Ocean acidification also hinders the growth of shelled organisms (crabs, shrimps, and lobsters) and coral reefs which can cause distruptions the natural food chain and overall biodiversity loss.</p><br>

        <p>Biodiversity ensures <b>balanced food webs</b> that helps the ecosystem to function. One of the cornerstones of marine biodiversity are coral reefs, they are necessary for about 25% of the ocean fish. With a wide size of 27,000 square kilometers and critical locations in the following Philippine provinces: Palawan (37%), Sulu (27.8%), Visayas (21.7%), Northern Luzon (7.6%), Central and Southern Mindanao (3.2%), and the Turtle Islands (1.7%), the country is home to one of the world’s largest coral reef systems being a part of the <b>Coral Triangle</b>.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="images/bg/coral-health.jpg" alt="Coral Health">
        <p>Despite their great value, <b>coral reefs are threatened by destruction</b> due to coastal development, fishing methods particularly dynamite and cyanide fishing, as well as natural causes which include extremely low tide, high temperature of surface water, predation, and the mechanical action of currents and waves. If left unchecked, with the reduced variety of fishes may lead to overgrowth of algae that suffocate seagrass—eventually to the point that the alage blocks sunlight and prevent coral from growing, halting reef recovery.</p>

        <p><b>A troubling decline in the Philippines’ fisheries output</b> is raising alarms among ocean conservationists, who warn that the trend could lead to a food security crisis. PSA reported an 8.8% decline in marine municipal fisheries production, dropping from 879.96 thousand metric tons in 2023 to 802.77 thousand metric tons in 2024, the lowest since 2002. <b>Millions of small-scale fishers could lose their livelihoods</b>, while coastal communities — where most rely on fishing for survival — face increased risks of malnutrition.</p>
        <br><p>Fisheries contribute substantially to the economic and social fibre of the Philippines, <b>providing
        employment to over 1.95 million people engaged in fish-related activities </b>(DA-BFAR, 2020a). In 2019,
        the Philippine fisheries sectors were estimated to contribute <b>228 billion PhP </b>to
        the national economy, comprising 1.2% of the Philippines GDP at current prices (DA-BFAR, 2020a). Hence, not only does declining fish supply affect food security, but it also impacts the viability of fishing as a form of employment and income. Still, local fishiries has no choice but compete directly for the same dwindling fish stocks.</p><br>
