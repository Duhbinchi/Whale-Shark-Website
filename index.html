            <h3>Cardiovascular Health</h3>
          <p>Diets high in marine-derived omega-3 fats improve heart health. 
            <br><br>Studies show that people with the highest fish intake have ~15% lower risk of heart failure than those with the lowest intake.

            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p> Fish and seafood are dietary cornerstones for Filipinos. The Philippines consumes ~40 kg of fish per person annually, making it the top source of animal protein. 
            <br><br>In the Philippines, seafood is a cheap and accessible source of protein, rich in micronutrients, such as iron, zinc, vitamin A, and omega 3 fatty acids. As such, seafood has significant potential to contribute towards alleviating food insecurity, malnutrition, stunting, and cardiovascular disease, while strengthening the immune system and improving maternal and childhood health outcomes.

            <h3>Brain Development and Mental Health</h3>
          <p>Fish consumption provides docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid essential for brain development in infants and cognitive function in adults. Adequate intake during pregnancy and early childhood is linked to improved cognitive outcomes.<br><br>Also, regular fish consumption (≥2 servings/week) is linked to 20% lower depression risk and improved cognitive function. Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA/EPA) reduce neuroinflammation and support neurotransmitter activity.

            <h3>Oxygen Production</h3>
          <p>Algae (including phytoplankton) generate 50-80% of Earth's oxygen through photosynthesis—more than all rainforests combined.
            <br><br>This oxygen supports life both in oceans and on land, contributing significantly to air quality and respiratory health. Their oxygen production also drives the global carbon cycle, which indirectly moderates climate and associated respiratory stressors
